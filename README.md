# ScratchBuilt_MachineLearning_Models



Building machine learning models from scatch, using numpy to better appreciate the intuition behind forward 
- propagation,
- back propagation
- gradient descent
- application of numpy in machine learning algorithms

As i felt that it was important to build fundamental knowledge to better appreciate Deep Learning models
